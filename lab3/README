Q1:	How to compile the program?
A1:	Just type the following command in your terminal:
	
	$ make

Q2:	How to run the program?
A1:	First start the server by using the follwing command:
	
	$ ./ftps 1040
	
	This command will launch the server. The server will be
	binded to 1040 port. If you want to
	launch the client in the same machine or terminal,
	please use the following command instead:
	
	$ ./ftps 1040 &
	
	This command will launch the server in the background,
	so that you can continue to launch your client in the
	same machine/terminal. After the server in launched,
	you will see the following information:
	
	$ TCP server waiting for remote connection from clients ...

	This message indicates that the server is successfully
	started. Now you can go ahead to start your client using
	the following command:

	$ ./ftpc <host-ip> <remote-port> <file-to-be-sent>

	For example, suppose the server is started on 164.107.113.21,
	the port number is 1040 and you want to send a file called
	foo. Then you can launch the client using the following
	command:

	$ ./ftpc 164.107.113.21 1040 foo

	Once the server starts receiving the file,
	the following message will be printed out:
	
	$ Create a directory named FTPFolder to hold the file.
	$ Server receiving file foo...

	After successfully send out the file, the client will
	automatically end itself. Once the server successfully
	receives the file, it will automatically stop.
