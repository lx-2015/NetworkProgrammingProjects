Q:	How to make the program?
A:	Type the following command in your terminal.
	$ make

Q:	How to run the program?
A:	Type the following command in your terminal.
	$ ./count <inputfile-name> <search-string> <outputfile-name>

Q:	How to deal with error "ERROR: Wrong usage of count...."?
A:	In order to launch count program, you have to specify three parameters
	other than the program's name:
	1. The name of the input file;
	2. The string you want to search;
	3. The name of the output file.
	Let say you have an input file called "input". You want to search string
	"hey" in the input file. And you want to save the result into a file
	called "output". Then you should launch the count program using the
	following command:
	$ ./count input hey output

Q:	How to deal with error "ERROR: Input file xxx cannot be read."?
A:	The reason you are facing with such a program is either your specified
	input file does not exist or you don't have the permission to read it.
	Please try changing the permission of the input file or change another
	input file.

Q:	How to deal with error "ERROR: Output file xxx already exists."?
A:	As indicated by the error message, your specified output file already
	exists. Please try to use another output file name.

Q:	How to deal with other errors?
A:	If other error message occurs, please contact with the author using the
	following email address:

	I'm happy to help.

Enjoy!
